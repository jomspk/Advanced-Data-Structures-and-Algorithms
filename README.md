# Advanced-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

## Objectives and attainment goals

The core course covers several advanced data structures related to balanced search trees, range queries, sets and persistent data structures as well as advanced algorithms for string, networks, computational geometry and artificial intelligence. Students should seek to develop a solid understanding of common and practical data structures as well as techniques used in their implementation to solve real world problems.
